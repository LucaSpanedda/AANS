# Repository for Artificial Neural Networks studies in the Digital Signal Processing realm, coded in Faust - AANs

The reason behind these studies is in the need to find methods to create nonlinearities in the Complex Adaptive Systems (CASes) I am making in Faust, with the purpose of generating nonlinear control signals within the networks as autonomous forms of intelligence; or nonlinear synthesis signals.

The starting idea comes from some videos and blog posts by [Simon Hutchinson](https://simonhutchinson.com/), who delved into the idea of using in the Pure Data Programming language the generation of Audio Signals through Neuron functions and through forms of ANNs.

Some interesting videos and posts by Simon on the subject are

One of the first relevant experiences in the use of Artificial Neural Networks is in the case of [David Tudor's Neural Synthesis]([Analog Neural Synthesis - MLure.art](https://mlure.art/analog-neural-synthesis/)). David Tudor in '89, after a show in Berkeley, met the designer and planner Forrest Warthman, who introduced him to the idea of using analog neural networks to combine all his complex live-electronics activity into a single computer.  One of the appreciable results is in the CD's "Neural Synthesis" series, in one of which there are [important liner notes by Warthman](http://www.lovely.com/albumnotes/notes1602.html)
